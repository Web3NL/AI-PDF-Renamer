# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - PDF Metadata Extraction Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Ready
- ✓ All Python dependencies installed (`pdf2image`, `pillow`, `google-generativeai`)
- ✓ Poppler utilities installed for PDF processing
- ✓ PDF metadata extraction script created
- ✓ Three PDF files ready for processing in `src/` folder

## 🔑 What You Need to Do
**Get your Gemini API key:**

1. **Visit**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Click** "Create API Key"
4. **Copy** the generated key
5. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
   ```

6. **Make it permanent** (optional):
   ```bash
   echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## 🚀 Run the Extraction
Once your API key is set:
```bash
python3 pdf_metadata_extractor.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results
The script will extract from your PDFs:
- **Title**: Full title of the academic paper
- **Author**: Author name(s) 
- **Year**: Publication year
- **Source**: Original filename

Results will be:
- Displayed in terminal with emojis and formatting
- Saved to `pdf_metadata_results.json` for further processing

## 📁 Your PDFs to Process
- `Assis - A new method for inductance.pdf`
- `Assis - Circuit theory in Weber electrodynamic.pdf`
- `Koen van Vlaenderen - GCED 04-12-2015.pdf`

## 🛠 Available Scripts
- `python3 pdf_metadata_extractor.py` - Main extraction script
- `python3 setup_check.py` - Verify all dependencies
- `python3 demo_results.py` - See sample output format

## 💡 Notes
- The Gemini API can process images very effectively for text extraction
- First few pages of PDFs are converted to images for analysis
- API usage may have costs for large volumes
- Results accuracy depends on PDF quality and text clarity
